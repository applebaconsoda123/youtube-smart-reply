It's vital for a creator to not only publish interesting, captivating content, but also to address and interact with the viewer directly. 
A possible hypothesis that can therefore be made is: "If creators interact with their audience on a personal level as close as possible to 1-to-1, then the audience will feel more positively towards the creator."

YouTube Studio already has a function called "Smart Replies", which according to YouTube, are "comment suggestions based on the most commonly used creator replies seen on YouTube". However, this process is still manual- the creator still needs to go and select a comment, choose from available replies, and send that comment.

Would it therefore be possible to automate this reply commenting process for creators by utilizing a LLM such as GPT-3.5? There are several limitations, which include (but are not limited to) YouTube's max API quota, quality of generated comments, and cost. Additionally, in a worst case scenario, any failures (e.g. unintended glitches causing creator replies to go haywire or comment unintentional statements) could cause audiences to feel ostracized or even cheated of a "personal" connection.

Furthermore, there are moral and ethical issues (https://www.thejsms.org/index.php/JSMS/article/view/304). The topic of parasocial interactions extends to YouTube; wouldn't automating such a process raise issues regarding, among many problems, the goal of a creator, which is to provide value to your target audience? What value does automating the creator-audience interaction process give to the audience, rather than the creator?
